<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Krishna, an aspiring web developer passionate about creating structured 
   and well-organized web pages. I have a strong foundation in HTML and a growing 
   interest in front-end development.</p>

<p>I enjoy building clean, accessible, and user-friendly websites. 
   My focus is on writing semantic HTML and ensuring a strong foundation 
   for web design. As I continue learning, I aim to expand my skills in CSS, 
   JavaScript, and responsive web design.</p>

<p>When I'm not coding, I explore new technologies and improve my knowledge by 
   working on small projects. Feel free to check out my work and connect with me!</p>
